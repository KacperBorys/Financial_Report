## Project DescriptionðŸ–Š
1.We export a financial report of a selected company listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (e.g. CD Projekt) in an Excel file format.
2.The program calculates important financial indicators (e.g. ROE, ROA, ROS, C/WK... there are approximately 10 of them) for the company based on the available data from the financial report.
3.Using the Matplotlib library, the program plots changes in the most important financial indicators and categories (net profit, revenue, costs, operating costs) for the selected company.

### PandasðŸ“•
The pandas library is one of the most extensive packages for data analysis in Python. It allows us to load, clean, modify, and even analyze data from Excel, among other things.

### TkinterðŸ“—
The tkinter library enables us to create fairly simple windowed applications using virtually all standard system controls.

### MatplotlibðŸ“˜
The matplotlib library is a very extensive and advanced package that offers a lot of data visualization options. It allows for editing and adjusting charts.

## Data PreparationðŸ”¢
We will need a financial report of a selected company listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in an Excel file format.

We will be interested in such data as:
* "Net profit/(loss)";
* "Current assets";
* "Total assets";
* "Sales revenue";
* "Equity";
* "Current assets", "Short-term liabilities";
* "Trade receivables";
* "Cost of goods sold, services, goods and materials";
* "Inventories";
* "Long-term liabilities".

It is essential to correctly save the indicators in the Excel program. Moreover, the financial report should include statistics from 4 years.

## ConclusionðŸ”š
To sum up, the Scripting Languages Project is aimed at exporting and analyzing financial reports of selected companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The program calculates important financial indicators and plots changes in the most critical categories using the Matplotlib library. To run the project correctly, pandas, tkinter, and matplotlib libraries must be downloaded. The financial report should include statistics from the past four years, and it is essential to correctly save the indicators in the Excel program. Overall, this project can be useful for financial analysis and investment decision-making.
